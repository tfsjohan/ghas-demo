# GitHub Advanced Security

This is a simple demo to show how to use GitHub Advanced Security to find and fix security vulnerabilities in your code.

## Dependabot

* Enable Dependabot
* Dependabot Security Updates
* Dependabot Version Updates
* Dependabot Pull Requests

## Code Scanning

### Enable Code Scanning

Settings > Code Security & Analysis > Code analysis settings

### The Security Tab

* Show how to view security vulnerabilities in the Security tab
* Show Code Paths to follow the code to the vulnerability
* Show how to create an Issue to fix the vulnerability

### Fixing the Vulnerability

* Show how to create a branch for the Issue and open in CodeSpaces
* Show how to use Copilot to help write the fix using the /fix command
* Show how to create a Pull Request
* Show how to use Copilot Enterprise to explain the fix in the Pull Request

### When Code Scanning doesn't find the vulnerability

* Show that CodeQL can't find all problems, for instance with Asp.net Model Binding
